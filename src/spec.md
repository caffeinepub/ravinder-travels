# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish (deploy) the current Ravinder Travels website build so the live site serves the latest working frontend and backend.

**Planned changes:**
- Perform a full build and deployment of the Motoko backend canister and the React frontend.
- Resolve/avoid the previously observed “Version 2” deployment failure so deployment completes successfully.
- Verify the deployed site loads the Marketing page, the “Book a Ride / Request a Quote” form submits successfully to the deployed backend, and the Admin view can authenticate and load booking requests.

**User-visible outcome:** The live Ravinder Travels site loads the latest build without errors, visitors can submit booking/quote requests successfully, and admins can still sign in and view booking requests.
