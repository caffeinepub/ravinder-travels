  "summary": "REQ-1 through REQ-4 appear implemented: a new static AMP landing page was added with AMP runtime/boilerplate and canonical link; the canonical `frontend/index.html` now links to the AMP page while preserving the Google verification meta tag; `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` were added to allow crawling and include the AMP URL; and the deployment checklist now includes an AMP validation smoke test. However, the diff also includes substantial unrelated frontend/theme/app changes and modifies files that were explicitly constrained as immutable (notably `frontend/src/main.tsx` and `frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts`).",
