  "summary": "Diff primarily adds an asset URL helper and updates image references to use it, plus adds a frontend deployment checklist. It does not provide verifiable evidence of an actual full build+deployment of backend and frontend, nor changes clearly addressing the previously observed “Version 2 deployment failure.”",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Publish the current application version by performing a full build and deployment of both the Motoko canister backend and the React frontend, ensuring the deployment succeeds (including avoiding the previously observed Version 2 deployment failure) and the live site serves the latest build.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code/documentation changes (asset URL handling and a deployment checklist) but no evidence of the actual build/deploy being performed or of deployment configuration changes that would ensure deployment succeeds (and specifically avoids the prior Version 2 deployment failure). The acceptance criteria are runtime/deploy outcomes that cannot be confirmed from the shown changes.",
